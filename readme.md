# Stardew Valley Crop Planner

This will hopefully be a version that includes JSON Assets crops. Forked on 2020-09-13, be patient please.

A tool for planning crop schedules in the Stardew Valley game.

Note that this does include one spoiler for Stardew Valley Expanded.

I'll be leaving <a href="http://exnil.github.io/crop_planner/v1/" target="_blank">v1 of the planner</a> up for anyone who's interested in accessing it, though I won't be updating it any further so it will only ever be up to date with Stardew Valley v1.07.

### Crop Info
Crop info is stored in config.json. This data is retrieved from game files in *[install dir]/Content/Data/*, specifically Crops.xnb and ObjectInformation.xnb. I use <a href="https://github.com/Draivin/XNBNode" target="_blank">XNBNode by Draivin</a> to decompress these files and parse them with a Python script to save into the config.json file.

### Development Utilities
If you are interested in contributing to the Crop Planner, I have included some Python utility scripts that I use in my development workflow. These are located in *./utils/*, and require Python 3 to run. Each script has its own dependencies:

* <b>update-config.py</b> - Updates crop data in config.json using data from decompiled game files
 * Dependencies:
 * Stardew Valley
 * <a href="https://github.com/Draivin/XNBNode" target="_blank">XNBNode</a>
 * xcompress32.dll (proprietary dll required by XNBNode, place in XNBNode folder)
* <b>watch-less.py</b> - Watches style.less for changes and recompiles CSS using Less CSS
 * Dependencies:
 * less (Less CSS)
 * less-plugin-clean-css (for minifying the resulting CSS)
 * <a href="http://lesscss.org/usage/#command-line-usage" target="_blank">Install with npm</a>

### Item Prices
All items have a **base price** which the game uses to calculate the sell price (when you ship items) and buy price (when you buy items from stores) of that item. Buy price is simply <code>Base Price * 2</code>.

The calculation for sell price of an item (without added Profession bonuses) is below. The Quality of an item is used numerically as a multiplier: 0 for regular; 1 for silver; 2 for gold.
<pre>
(int) Sell Price = Base Price * (1 + (Quality * 0.25))
</pre>

*Note: some items have sell/buy prices that deviate from the above formulas. These prices are likely hard-coded into the game.*

### Profit-per-day
Crop profits-per-day are calculated using the <b><i>minimum sell price</i></b> of a crop.<br>
Profit per day: <code>((Total Yields * Sells For) - (Seed Price * Total Plantings)) / (Final Harvest Date - 1)</code>

<b>Example 1 - Parsnip</b><br>
Parsnips take 4 days to grow after the day they are planted. In Spring, they can be planted 6 times and yield a total of 6 Parsnips, assuming replanting occurs on the same day of harvesting. The last harvest occurs on Day 25. Seeds cost 20g, and Parsnips sell for a minimum of 35g.
<pre>
((6 * 35g) - (20g * 6)) / (25 - 1)
90g / 24
<b>= 3.75g/day</b>
</pre>


<b>Example 2 - Corn</b><br>
Corn takes 14 days to grow after the day it is planted. In Spring and Fall, it is planted once and can yield a total of 11 Corn. The last harvest occurs on Day 55. Seeds cost 150g, and Corn sells for a minimum of 50g.
<pre>
((11 * 50g) - (150g * 1)) / (55 - 1)
400g / 54
<b>= 7.4g/day</b>
</pre>
